# CS4420Project
While it is possible to look at the transcript of an audio file, there is no system available for users to easily query other data points related to the audio file that are not the text that is said. Non-speech based audio files like sounds of nature do not have much room for further analysis. There is some opportunity to do analysis of music audio specifically, but there is still a gap present for speech-based audio files. Non-experts in audio analysis should have the same opportunity to parse audio and conduct analysis on additional features of audio in addition to typical metadata of audio files.
